<p><strong>I never liked mathâ€¦</strong> Until this year, until I got into programming seriously. Although I now enjoy math and science that doesnâ€™t change the fact that Iâ€™m not very good at it. Iâ€™m getting better but Iâ€™m still not exceptional.</p>

<p>Thanks to my only god: <strong>the internet</strong> I discovered that algorithms and data structures are considered the fundamentals of computer science. That means thatâ€™s where Iâ€™m headed now ! Apparently two basic types of algorithms are searching and sorting algorithms. So here it goes.</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>I just remembered that I also implemented the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.</p>

<p>When I checked my Sieve of Eratosthenes program for correctness I realized that Iâ€™d made a terrible mistake: <strong>my program ran for n times instead of square root of n times</strong>. I was absolutely shook because I remember that my math teacher mentioned such a thing. I think itâ€™s at that moment that I really regretted not listening more in math class.</p>
