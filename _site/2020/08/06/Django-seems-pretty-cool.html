<p>But I’m not into Django to build websites. I don’t need to build any
websites at the moment (jekyll made the only website I needed ; this one
!) so why would I need to learn Django ? To see my projects in the
browser ! That’s the only reason why. I also want to make a website
where you could try all of the projects I’ve ever made. It would be
sooooo cool if I could create such a portfolio site I think it would
look really good for my college applications. BTW if you are an
admissions officer and you are reading this: 15 year old me doesn’t know
what the current Daren is worth but going to college to study comp-sci
is my dream. I want to hang out with people who share the same interests
as me and study and learn in the field that I have the most passion for.
With that being said, I enjoy arguments and debating and my political
views will not be the plainest you’ve ever seen but if you still think
that I could be a good fit for your school, let me in it’ll be my honor
to join your student body. <strong>This concludes my monolog for the imaginary
admissions officer who lives in my head</strong>.</p>

<p>This also concludes this blog post. As an update on my progress in that comp-sci book I was talking about in my previous posts: I haven’t had time to continue reading it because of the <strong>5 other fucking books that I have to read for school.</strong> Up to now I’ve read <em>Albert Camus - L’étranger</em>, <em>Albert Camus - Les justes</em>, <em>Benjamin Constant - Adolphe</em> and <em>Aimé Césaire - Discours sur le colonialisme</em>. They were all really good books (especially Camus’s) but I also have to read <em>Margaret Atwood - The Handmaid’s tale</em> which is a big book to read in 3 weeks especially when I still have 4 books to read for French left.</p>

<p>I’ll keep y’all up to date with my reading schedule.</p>

<p>PS: read Albert Camus, he’s an absolute genius who 100% deserved his nobel prize.</p>
