<p>I started my programming journey with Python 3 in the beginning of 2019
and I absolutely love it. I love writing it, I love discovering new ways
to use it, I’m always amazed by the number of free libraries it has and
the number of free learning resources online make it deserving of its
reputation as the beginner’s language. And it’s exactly this reputation
that made me want to find my next love. This happened right at the
beginning of the Covid-19 quarantine in France and I decided to use my
time indoors to find the next step in my programming story (who am I
kidding? I would’ve spent the day inside even without the pandemic).</p>

<p>And so it started… I opened codecademy and chose C++. I wanted to be a
big dick programmer and I like hardware so I chose C++. I enjoyed the
tutorial, finished it in a week (I wasn’t entirely dedicated to it, my
friends were harassing me to facetime with them). As anyone who just
finished the beginner tutorial of a language I set off to find a project
that was beginner friendly. All the suggestions that I found were
sooooooooo dull! A bunch of bank account management programs, accounting
programs, library management programs. I understand that these type of
projects are good to learn about custom objects and database management
but damn are they boring. Nevertheless, I wrote an absolutely crappy
library management program. I sucked ass, was super boring to code, it
wasn’t even usable and as I finished the project I thought to myself
“Wow I could’ve done that in 1/4 of the time in Python and the result
would’ve been absolutely the same. Hell ! I wanted to learn C++ to get
my hands dirty and I just couldn’t see how C++ would do that for me. So
I moved onto JavaScript.</p>

<p>JavaScript was a fun one. The course was longer than C++ but I enjoyed
it a lot more. It was the first time I heard about asynchronous
programming and I thought it was a really interesting concept and got me
interested in backend but I didn’t have the skills to pay the bills yet
so I started with front-end and created a little calculator that is
available on my <a href="https://github.com/ColleSerre">github</a> but please don’t
go look at it because it’s absolutely the worst ; right after I got it
working I sweared that I’d make it look prettier but I remembered that I
really hate front-end coding (can’t really call it programming ; you’ll
get used to me despising HTML and CSS). I did try ReactJS after
JavaScript to start learning the MERN stack I really like JavaScript but
I really hate front-end and can’t handle the environment (I’m very bad
at managing Windows which is why I run Linux, specifically pop-Os, on my
laptop and Windows 10 on my desktop which I find crucial for gaming). I
can still code in JavaScript but my good friend Adrien Dumont is way
better than me (he’s more talented in web-development than me in every
single way and is probably going to change the web in unfathomable ways,
for real he’s an incredible guy). He and I have a course to give at my
school next year but that’s a story for another day, or post.</p>

<p>Adrien may be a good friend, a great web-developer and a low-key genius
but he is too focused on making money and getting a job at some big tech
firm and doesn’t seem to give two shits about what’s happening under the
hood. I don’t think he has any desire to study computer science and he’s
a JavaScript aficionados. Not criticizing him but he keeps choosing the
tech/frameworks he uses because it’s popular and companies want it but
not because it’s cool tech and he enjoys using it which I think is sad.
We’re 16 years old and we still have a few years till we go off to
college to code nothing but C so let’s enjoy the plethora of
interesting, fun and obscure frameworks the world has to offer !</p>

<p>I then followed a C tutorial (in another attempt to get my hands dirty)
but I really didn’t enjoy the programming experience. After that, I read
<em>L’étranger</em> by Albert Camus and <em>The Communist Manifesto</em> by Karl Marx
and Friedrich Engels which made me want to make an app to read <em>The
Communist Manifesto</em>, of course I had no idea such an app already
existed. I therefore did codecademy’s Java tutorial and began the Kotlin
tutorial but I discovered google’s Flutter framework. At last! I had
finally found my second programming love. I know, I know I’ve said
terrible things about front-end programming but this felt so much better
! The programming experience was exceptiona, the VS Code extension was
incredible, the android emulation was really handy and I’ll never forget
the thrill of flashing my first app to my phone and trying it out on my
own device. I spent about 3 weeks on the app (didn’t release it) and
experienced working with APIs for the first time yet (News API to be
precise) and put my asynchronous programming skills to good use.</p>

<p>If you’ve read my previous blogpost you’ll know that this euphoria
didn’t last very long. I enjoyed Flutter but I felt like I wasn’t really
programming and just using a complex design tool. I missed the problem
solving that came with my previous programming projects. So I
uninstalled Flutter from my computers and got obsessed by HackeRank (a
website that offers a bunch of problem solving exercises). I can’t solve
medium level problems and settle for easy but it feels like I’m really
programming and making my brain work and not just using the tools that a
team built for me without understanding the way it works.</p>

<p>And so came the end of quarantine and with it came the end of my burning
question: “What language should I focus on?”. And I think I’ve finally
found an answer. You like Python? Then use Python. You’ll have to use C
in college but you’ll have classes that’ll explain the <strong>good</strong> way to
write C code. Developing bad habits in the most important language of
your college education seems like a bad idea…</p>

<p>My next post will be about a book I just got called “A Programmer’s
Guide to Computer Science” by PhD William Springer. I started reading it
and I’m finding the data structures section very interesting.</p>
