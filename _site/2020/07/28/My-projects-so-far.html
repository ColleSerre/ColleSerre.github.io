<p>Of course you could find all of these on my
<a href="https://github.com/ColleSerre">github</a> but it’s important for me to
reflect on all these by writing it down here.</p>

<p>My first real project was <strong>Scraping tool</strong>. I thought (and still do)
that web-scraping was one of the coolest things you could do with
Python, which was the first language I learnt and that I consider to be
my primary language. I initially called it <strong>Scraping API</strong> but later
realized that it wasn’t much of an API because the output was just
displayed on the CLI and not in a JSON file or any kind of reuseable
file. This is a very basic CLI project which I will maybe revive at some
point (not likely).</p>

<p>Then came Red and Gold. My biggest project yet…At first it was just
supposed to be an app to read the communist manifesto but it evolved
into a timeline, news feed and encyclopaedia of the communist movement.
It didn’t get released, I’ll maybe come around to publishing it someday
if I’m super bored but Android development and release is messy and
painful for me. It was a fun project to work on though, <strong>my first time
using an API</strong> too. I just realised that my future self will maybe read
these lines. That’s super scary but also super cool! I’ve made the lines
above <strong>bold</strong> so that you’ll read this part first future me. You’re
welcome! I hope you remember me and aren’t too embarrassed by 15 year
old you. If time travel exists (probably won’t and even if it does you
won’t be able to use it) give me a shout right now. At 21:17 on Tuesday
the 28th of June 2020. I’ll just wait a few minutes if anything
happens… It’s 21:17 and nothing has happened.</p>

<p>We got off track. After I realised that Flutter made me dumb and that I
hated the idea of it I decided to become a big boy developer and used
HackerRank to learn about data structures, problem solving and
algorithms. It felt so much more like home! I always disliked front-end
developers. At the beginning of the year I said that I hated web
developers. That’s not true. Some web developers do some great job. It’s
not the platform that I hate, the web is amazing and I’m determined
that’s it’s the platform of the present and future, but the idea that
some people spend most of their time picking which font is the best for
their project or which color suits their landing page best makes me want
to walk into Fort Knox and pay General Mark McDonald to order his men to
fire me up with every weapon they got. <strong>Code should come before
esthetics.</strong> I know some front-end developers will say: “but if your
tech is ugly and difficult to use no one will buy it!” to which I will
respond: “Fuck you and everyone around you. You make me want to go to my
local practitioner and ask him to prescribe me a medicinal M32 rotary
grenade launcher to cure the crippling depression you put me in. I’d
like to conclude my point on this note: <strong>I don’t give two shits if no
one wants to buy my tech.</strong> I’m not in it for the money, I’m in it for
the thrill of creating something that can change the world and make it a
better place (I know douchebag in Silicon Valley has said that but I
truly believe it).</p>

<p>I got off track again. Now I enjoy coding small, fast and useful
projects in whatever language I want (usually python but I’m not married
to it like some people are). I know it’s not the best way to build an
impressive portfolio but that’s where I am now.</p>

<p>My next post will be about my trip through hell (trying to find the
perfect programming field and language). I’ve been there and I don’t
wish it to anyone, not even front-end developers from Twitter.</p>
