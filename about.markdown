I'm Daren Palmer, an anglo-french teenager passionate about computers, tech and programming.

My dream is to go to college to study computer-science. Right now McGill is my number one choice because I would love to live in a bilingual country and I love speaking french and it would suck to lose that. Second choice would be Cambridge, although I'm not sure I'm capable to pass the exam. Finally I'd like to go to Edinburgh, apparently it's a great city and the computer-science department seems really good.

Here's my [github](https://github.io/ColleSerre) if you want to have a look at it. 

I code a lot but I have trouble finding big projects to work on. I usually code on small projects that I finish in a few evenings but I've had some longer, bigger projects.
