### You know my opinions on front-end development

But I'm not into Django to build websites. I don't need to build any
websites at the moment (jekyll made the only website I needed ; this one
!) so why would I need to learn Django ? To see my projects in the
browser ! That's the only reason why. I also want to make a website
where you could try all of the projects I've ever made. It would be
sooooo cool if I could create such a portfolio site I think it would
look really good for my college applications. BTW if you are an
admissions officer and you are reading this: 15 year old me doesn't know
what the current Daren is worth but going to college to study comp-sci
is my dream. I want to hang out with people who share the same interests
as me and study and learn in the field that I have the most passion for.
With that being said, I enjoy arguments and debating and my political
views will not be the plainest you've ever seen but if you still think
that I could be a good fit for your school, let me in it'll be my honor
to join your student body. **This concludes my monolog for the imaginary
admissions officer who lives in my head**.

This also concludes this blog post. As an update on my progress in that comp-sci book I was talking about in my previous posts: I haven't had time to continue reading it because of the **5 other fucking books that I have to read for school.** Up to now I've read *Albert Camus - L'étranger*, *Albert Camus - Les justes*, *Benjamin Constant - Adolphe* and *Aimé Césaire - Discours sur le colonialisme*. They were all really good books (especially Camus's) but I also have to read *Margaret Atwood - The Handmaid's tale* which is a big book to read in 3 weeks especially when I still have 4 books to read for French left.

I'll keep y'all up to date with my reading schedule.

PS: read Albert Camus, he's an absolute genius who 100% deserved his nobel prize.
