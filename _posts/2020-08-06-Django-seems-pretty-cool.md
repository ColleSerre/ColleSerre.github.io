### You know my opinions on front-end development

But I'm not into Django to build websites. I don't need to build any
websites at the moment (jekyll made the only website I needed ; this one
!) so why would I need to learn Django ? To see my projects in the
browser ! That's the only reason why. I also want to make a website
where you could try all of the projects I've ever made. It would be
sooooo cool if I could create such a portfolio site I think it would
look really good for my college applications. BTW if you are an
admissions officer and you are reading this: 15 year old me doesn't know
what the current Daren is worth but going to college to study comp-sci
is my dream. I want to hang out with people who share the same interests
as me and study and learn in the field that I have the most passion for.
With that being said, I enjoy arguments and debating and my political
views will not be the plainest you've ever seen but if you still think
that I could be a good fit for your school, let me in it'll be my honor
to join your student body. **This concludes my monolog for the imaginary
admissions officer who lives in my head**.
