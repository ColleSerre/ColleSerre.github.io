#### There's a lot to talk about...

I've started a new project with my friend Adrien, and it could be something big ! So far, we haven't thought of a name so we're calling it Clubhouse_timed (sexy right ?). It's an app that allows you to enter a voice call with a random person for 3 minutes. When the time runs out, you get prompted to add the person on social media. This app has been in the works for nearly a month and a half and so far we have: Google, Twitter and Instagram authentication (I had to be really hacky for the latter). We also have login, call and main menu views. Unfortunately, we don't have the actual voice call integration (yet). Adrien is hard at work to create a WebRTC server using PeerJS and NodeJS and I was supposed to get it by the end of this week which means I'll have to hit him up. While he was doing that, I finished most of the UI and cloud backend, we basically need to polish the initial sign-up flow and create a settings view and of course implement the call functionality. Honestly, this project takes up most of my free time and has really unveiled the weaknesses of Flutter (I haven't mentionned we're using Flutter as our UI framework). Now hear me out, yes Flutter is a great framework which allows us to share 100% of our code between Android and iOS. But, when it comes to APIs, app authorizations and overall real use cases that any big project encounters, Flutter tends to be a little awkward. The thing is that when running big projects using a cloud backend, many third-party authentication services and a high-functionning database, your Flutter code relies on one widget: FutureBuilder. This widget is used to render UI after an asynchronous function is run. In theory, there shoulnd't be any issues when using it a lot but in practice it produces unclear widget trees and a messy app structure. This is just a small part of our widget tree.

I'm not sure if this is an issue that is common to all mobile development frameworks/languages but it reminded me of the 'callback hell' that I've heard JavaScript developer complain about. I'm hoping that we're going to be able to go to market before the summer holidays so I can lay back and reap the benefits of my *obviously* fantastic app. I really wished Adrien had some more experience using Flutter because it's really not easy to develop an entire mobile app by yourself in a month, especially for my sleep schedule. But, it'll all be worth it in the end. Feel free to take a look at the source code on [github](https://github.com/ColleSerre/clubhouse_timed).
