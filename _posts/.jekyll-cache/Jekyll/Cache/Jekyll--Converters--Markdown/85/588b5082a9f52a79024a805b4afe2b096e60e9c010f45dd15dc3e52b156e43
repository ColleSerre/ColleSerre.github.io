<p>I started my programming journey with Python 3 in the beginning of 2019
and I absolutely love it. I love writing it, I love discovering new ways
to use it, Iâ€™m always amazed by the number of free libraries it has and
the number of free learning resources online make it deserving of its
reputation as the beginnerâ€™s language. And itâ€™s exactly this reputation
that made me want to find my next love. This happened right at the
beginning of the Covid-19 quarantine in France and I decided to use my
time indoors to find the next step in my programming story (who am I
kidding? I wouldâ€™ve spent the day inside even without the pandemic).</p>

<p>And so it startedâ€¦ I opened codecademy and chose C++. I wanted to be a
big dick programmer and I like hardware so I chose C++. I enjoyed the
tutorial, finished it in a week (I wasnâ€™t entirely dedicated to it, my
friends were harassing me to facetime with them). As anyone who just
finished the beginner tutorial of a language I set off to find a project
that was beginner friendly. All the suggestions that I found were
sooooooooo dull! A bunch of bank account management programs, accounting
programs, library management programs. I understand that these type of
projects are good to learn about custom objects and database management
but damn are they boring. Nevertheless, I wrote an absolutely crappy
library management program. I sucked ass, was super boring to code, it
wasnâ€™t even usable and as I finished the project I thought to myself
â€œWow I couldâ€™ve done that in 1/4 of the time in Python and the result
wouldâ€™ve been absolutely the same. Hell ! I wanted to learn C++ to get
my hands dirty and I just couldnâ€™t see how C++ would do that for me. So
I moved onto JavaScript.</p>

<p>JavaScript was a fun one. The course was longer than C++ but I enjoyed
it a lot more. It was the first time I heard about asynchronous
programming and I thought it was a really interesting concept and got me
interested in backend but I didnâ€™t have the skills to pay the bills yet
so I started with front-end and created a little calculator that is
available on my <a href="https://github.com/ColleSerre">github</a> but please donâ€™t
go look at it because itâ€™s absolutely the worst ; right after I got it
working I sweared that Iâ€™d make it look prettier but I remembered that I
really hate front-end coding (canâ€™t really call it programming ; youâ€™ll
get used to me despising HTML and CSS). I did try ReactJS after
JavaScript to start learning the MERN stack I really like JavaScript but
I really hate front-end and canâ€™t handle the environment (Iâ€™m very bad
at managing Windows which is why I run Linux, specifically pop-Os, on my
laptop and Windows 10 on my desktop which I find crucial for gaming). I
can still code in JavaScript but my good friend Adrien Dumont is way
better than me (heâ€™s more talented in web-development than me in every
single way and is probably going to change the web in unfathomable ways,
for real heâ€™s an incredible guy). He and I have a course to give at my
school next year but thatâ€™s a story for another day, or post.</p>

<p>Adrien may be a good friend, a great web-developer and a low-key genius
but he is too focused on making money and getting a job at some big tech
firm and doesnâ€™t seem to give two shits about whatâ€™s happening under the
hood. I donâ€™t think he has any desire to study computer science and heâ€™s
a JavaScript aficionados. Not criticizing him but he keeps choosing the
tech/frameworks he uses because itâ€™s popular and companies want it but
not because itâ€™s cool tech and he enjoys using it which I think is sad.
Weâ€™re 16 years old and we still have a few years till we go off to
college to code nothing but C so letâ€™s enjoy the plethora of
interesting, fun and obscure frameworks the world has to offer !</p>

<p>I then followed a C tutorial (in another attempt to get my hands dirty)
but I really didnâ€™t enjoy the programming experience. After that, I read
<em>Lâ€™Ã©tranger</em> by Albert Camus and <em>The Communist Manifesto</em> by Karl Marx
and Friedrich Engels which made me want to make an app to read <em>The
Communist Manifesto</em>, of course I had no idea such an app already
existed. I therefore did codecademyâ€™s Java tutorial and began the Kotlin
tutorial but I discovered googleâ€™s Flutter framework. At last! I had
finally found my second programming love. I know, I know Iâ€™ve said
terrible things about front-end programming but this felt so much better
! The programming experience was exceptiona, the VS Code extension was
incredible, the android emulation was really handy and Iâ€™ll never forget
the thrill of flashing my first app to my phone and trying it out on my
own device. I spent about 3 weeks on the app (didnâ€™t release it) and
experienced working with APIs for the first time yet (News API to be
precise) and put my asynchronous programming skills to good use.</p>

<p>If youâ€™ve read my previous blogpost youâ€™ll know that this euphoria
didnâ€™t last very long. I enjoyed Flutter but I felt like I wasnâ€™t really
programming and just using a complex design tool. I missed the problem
solving that came with my previous programming projects. So I
uninstalled Flutter from my computers and got obsessed by HackeRank (a
website that offers a bunch of problem solving exercises). I canâ€™t solve
medium level problems and settle for easy but it feels like Iâ€™m really
programming and making my brain work and not just using the tools that a
team built for me without understanding the way it works.</p>

<p>And so came the end of quarantine and with it came the end of my burning
question: â€œWhat language should I focus on?â€. And I think Iâ€™ve finally
found an answer. You like Python? Then use Python. Youâ€™ll have to use C
in college but youâ€™ll have classes thatâ€™ll explain the <strong>good</strong> way to
write C code. Developing bad habits in the most important language of
your college education seems like a bad ideaâ€¦</p>

<p>My next post will be about a book I just got called â€œA Programmerâ€™s
Guide to Computer Scienceâ€ by PhD William Springer. I started reading it
and Iâ€™m finding the data structures section very interesting.</p>
